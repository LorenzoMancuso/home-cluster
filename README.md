## taints and toleration

You add a taint to a node using kubectl taint. For example,

```
kubectl taint nodes node1 nodeType=core:NoSchedule
```

places a taint on node node1. The taint has key key1, value value1, and taint effect NoSchedule. This means that no pod will be able to schedule onto node1 unless it has a matching toleration.

To remove the taint added by the command above, you can run:

```
kubectl taint nodes node1 nodeType=core:NoSchedule-
```

```
tolerations:
- key: "nodeType"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "core"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```

For k3s you have to update the coredns template:
```
sudo nano /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests/coredns.yaml
```

## affinity

Examples of node affinities:
```
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
          operator: In
          values:
          - antarctica-east1
          - antarctica-west1
    preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    - weight: 1
      preference:
        matchExpressions:
        - key: another-node-label-key
          operator: In
          values:
          - another-node-label-value
```

Node affinity for core:
```
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    - weight: 1
      preference:
        matchExpressions:
        - key: nodeType
          operator: In
          values:
          - core
```

## mount disks

To run a script on startup using cron, you will need to do the following âˆ’

- Open a terminal and type "crontab -e" to open the cron table for editing.

- Add a new line at the bottom of the file in the following format:

  `@reboot /path/to/script arg1 arg2`
  This line tells cron to run the script located at "/path/to/script" with arguments "arg1" and "arg2" when the system reboots.

- Save and exit the cron table.

- Verify that the script is correctly added by typing `crontab -l` in the terminal.

- Restart your system to test that the script is being run on startup
